# Data Science Udacity
## Project Motivation
Base on the CRISP-DM approach, we want to know what effect the price tag for the listing, and for business understanding purpose there are 3 question been asked and will be answered on on the notebook.

- compare the two city which city have a average higher price and how they perform over the time
- what elements effect the price of the hosue the most
- Base on the element we find on 1 what element effect price in uptrend and how

## libraries used
The library used projetc are: pandas, time , skearn, matplotlib.

- pandas was use to clean and manage data
- time was use to calcuate amount of time use for the process to happen
- sklearn was use for modeling data and find key elements 
- matplotlib was use for final visualization purpose

## result for the project
- In this workbook we first try to compare the averge price cost among the two city across the year. And we find on average boston have a higher price tag compare to seattle. And there is a trend, both city's price tag reach a high at 2016-09.

- Then we run a correlation model and a machine learning model to find the elements who has the most impact toward price. For this step we find accommodates,bedroom,cleaning_fee,beds and bathroom contribute the most toward price of listing one the other hand bedroom, bathroom, home/apt,  cleaning fee and security deposit weight the most on classifing price.

- lastly we take a closer look at those element who have positve or uptrend relation with price.We notice elements who contribute to higher price are accommodates,bedroom,ect. All those element says a bigger place are the key toward higher price tag and it will have higher cleaning fee. 

- Suggestion: to well manage your place and make full use of the space(for example: try managing and make the place bigger to fill more room or bed, but at the same time make less sacrifice on the experience) is the quick way to rise your property's price tag.
